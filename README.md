## Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020

Stack Overflow is a popular question and answer website for programmers, with over 100 million unique visitors each month. Each year, Stack Overflow conducts an Annual Developer Survey to gather insights into the global developer community, including demographics, education, employment, and technology trends.

In this project, I used Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to analyze the results of the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2020. Using statistical techniques and data visualization, I explored the survey data to uncover patterns and insights about the global developer community.

The main objectives of this project were to:

* Gain insights into the demographics and characteristics of the global developer community
* Identify trends and patterns in developer education, employment, and technology preferences
* Share the findings of the analysis in a clear and engaging way
